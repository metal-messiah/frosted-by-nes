I'm Janesa AKA "Nes", and I created <span class="logo-orange-color italic">Frosted By Nes</span> to share my love of decorating custom buttercream cakes. I worked in a bakery as a cake decorator where I soon realized that I had a talent for creating beautiful and delicious cakes outside the norms of a typical bakery selection.</div><div>I have always made custom buttercream cakes for my friends and family, to celebrate special occasions. I decided to turn my hobby into a small business that could serve the community I love, by making custom buttercream creations. My cakes only use high quality ingredients and are made to order, decorated with intricate piping, lace, flowers and more. True to my heritage, I specialize in mexican vanilla cakes and buttercreams, but I love to work with my clients and strive to make <span class="logo-orange-color italic">any cake flavor and design that you can dream up</span>.</div><div>I have <span class="logo-orange-color italic">celiac disease</span>, so I know how hard it can be to find gluten free cakes that look and taste good. That’s why I specialize in making gluten free cakes that are moist, fluffy, and flavorful. I use delicious gluten free flour blends that feature almond, coconut, rice and tapioca flours, and am diligent to avoid any cross-contamination in my kitchen. I am also available to make standard cakes upon request, however I would not be surprised to find that you may prefer my gluten free cakes, they are that good! I enjoy bringing joy and sweetness to people’s lives through cake. If you are looking for a stunning and scrumptious cake for your next event, please consider supporting my journey by following me on <a href="https://instagram.com/frosted.by.nes">Instagram.</a>To design and order your own custom cakes, please <a href="/contact/">reach out to me directly</a>. I look forward to meeting you!</div></div></div><div class="flex evenly padded full"><div class="contain-height pointer-hover" style="margin-top:50px;min-width:200px;width:25vw"><img alt="Headshot of Nes, the Baker and Decorator of Frosted By Nes" class="centered-img image-shadow undefined" src="/nes-headshot.jpg" style="background:#8a738e;width:100%"><div class="text-center bold-small margin"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
