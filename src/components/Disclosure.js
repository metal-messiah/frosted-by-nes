Gluten containing foods are prepared in the same kitchen at separate times, and before thorough cleaning and disinfecting. However, as someone with symptomatic Celiac Disease, I can assure you that I am diligent in avoiding cross contamination, and I would not provide you with a gluten free cake that I would not eat myself! With that said, there is still a risk and you will need to decide if thatâ€™s a risk worth taking.</div>
